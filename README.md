OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

PROJECT:LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO

Objective: 
Learn Basic Arduino Programming: Blinking an LED helps beginners understand how to write and upload simple code to control hardware using Arduino.
Understand Digital Output: The project demonstrates how to turn a digital pin on and off, which is essential for controlling other devices like motors, sensors, and displays.

Key Activities:
Writing and Uploading Code: Create a simple Arduino program (sketch) that uses the digitalWrite() function to turn an LED on and off at set intervals, then upload it to the Arduino board.
Connecting the Circuit: Connect an LED and a resistor to the appropriate pins on the Arduino (typically using a breadboard) to complete the circuit for the LED to blink.

Technologies Used:
Arduino Microcontroller: The Arduino board, a microcontroller platform, processes the code and controls the LED's blinking by sending digital signals.
Embedded C/C++ Programming: The code is written in Arduino's programming language, based on C/C++, to instruct the microcontroller on how to interact with the LED.

Key Insights:
Digital Control Fundamentals: Blinking an LED demonstrates how microcontrollers like Arduino can control hardware through digital outputs, a basic concept for interacting with sensors, actuators, and more.
Timing and Delays: The project highlights the importance of timing in embedded systems, using functions like delay() to control the frequency of actions, which is essential for real-world applications.
