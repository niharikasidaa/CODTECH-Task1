OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

PROJECT:LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO

Objective: 

To learn basic Arduino programming by controlling an LED.
To understand how to interface hardware components with Arduino.

Components Used:

Arduino Board
LED
Resistor
Jumper Wires
Breadboard

Procedure:

Attach the LED and resistor to the Arduino's digital pin and ground

Create a program that turns the LED on and off using the digitalWrite() and delay() functions

 Upload the code from your computer to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

  Power the Arduino through USB or an external source.

  The LED will blink on and off based on the code timing.

  LED ON:

Key Activities:

Connect the LED to the Arduino board through a resistor and to a digital output pin.

Write and upload a simple Arduino sketch to make the LED blink at regular intervals.

Technologies Used:

Arduino Microcontroller: A programmable hardware platform used to control the LED.

Embedded C/C++ Programming: The language used to write the code that controls the blinking of the LED.
